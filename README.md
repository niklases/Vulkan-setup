# Vulkan-setup
Build files for building Vulkan Hello Triangle executables (CMake &amp; VS Solution templates).

Each build setup is treated as a separate repository and contains its own main.cpp file and its own potential dependencies.
Requires the [Vulkan SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/) and [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/).

Sample code is based on the Vulkan tutorial by Alexander Overvoorde
